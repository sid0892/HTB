MIRAI

1) Use nmap to scan machine and found port 53,22 and 80 open.

2) Port 80 found open, so used dirb to scan the webserver.

3) Found http://10.10.10.48/admin/ on the scan.

4) Visiting the site showed that it was running pi-hole.

5) Analysing the name and the service pi-hole allowed me to conclude that there may be a chance that SSH through mirai login may be possible.

6) Use default password to login to the machine:
        'ssh pi@10.10.10.48' - password:raspberry

7) user.txt is present on /home/pi/Desktop (ff837707441b257a20e32199d7c8838d)

8) Pi user can use sudo. So tried 'sudo cat /root/root.txt'.
	'I lost my original root.txt! I think I may have a backup on my USB stick...'

9) Checked /media/usbstick/. There is a damnit.txt file. It contains:
	'Damnit! Sorry man I accidentally deleted your files off the USB stick.
	 Do you know if there is any way to get them back?

	 -James'

10) Check the disks available (df -alh).

11) /dev/sdb is the USB which is mounted at /media/usbstick

12) Though the file is deleted. We can do 'cat /dev/sdb | strings' to extract strings. 

13) We can see the root.txt hash. (3d3e483143ff12ec505d026fa13e020b)
